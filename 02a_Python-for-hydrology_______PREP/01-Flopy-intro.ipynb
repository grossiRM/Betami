    "As you can see, in addition to the different FloPy subpackages, the syntax is different between the two versions. In general, the syntax for the `flopy.modflow` and `flopy.mf6` subpackages follows the respective MODFLOW versions they support. For example, `ModflowGwf` is simply a [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) representation of the MODFLOW 6 Groundwater Flow (GWF) model. Similarly, the Discretization Package (for the GWF model) class is named `ModflowGwfdis`. Arguments to the `ModflowGwfdis` constructor follow the input variables to MODFLOW 6."
